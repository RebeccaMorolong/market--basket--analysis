# Market Basket Analysis Project

This project performs Market Basket Analysis using the Apriori algorithm to discover association rules and frequent itemsets from transactional data. The goal is to uncover product combinations that frequently co-occur in transactions, which can be used for recommendations, promotions, and inventory management.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- One-hot encoding of transaction data
- Frequent itemset mining using Apriori (with support for `low_memory` mode)
- Association rule generation
- Customizable support and confidence thresholds
- Example visualizations (if included)

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- mlxtend
- jupyter (optional, for notebooks)

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy mlxtend jupyter
```

## Usage

1. **Prepare your data:**  
   Place your transactional data (CSV or Excel) in the project folder.

2. **Run the analysis:**  
   Open and execute the Jupyter notebook or Python script provided in this repository.

3. **Adjust parameters:**  
   You can change `min_support`, `min_confidence`, and other parameters in the notebook/script to suit your dataset.

4. **View results:**  
   The output will include frequent itemsets and association rules.

## Example

```python
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori, association_rules

# Load and preprocess your data...
frequent_itemsets = apriori(basket_onehot, min_support=0.01, use_colnames=True, low_memory=True)
rules = association_rules(frequent_itemsets, metric="confidence", min_threshold=0.5)
print(rules)
```
